\usage{
get_project_name()
}
\value{
Character string with the project name (e.g., "A" for \code{projects/A}),
or \code{NULL} if no project is found or project is at workspace root.
}
\description{
Infers the project name by calculating the relative path from workspace
root to project root. Useful for automatically determining which project
is being worked on.
}
\details{
This function finds the workspace and project roots, then extracts the
project identifier from the relative path. For a standard layout with
\code{projects/A}, returns "A".

Useful in reports and other contexts where you need to automatically
reference the current project:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{project <- get_project_name()
if (!is.null(project)) \{
    data <- tar_read_project("data", project = project)
\}
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
